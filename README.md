# Photospec: photography critiquing application
This is my Master's thesis project for Harvard Extension, class of 2015. Built with MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node (MEAN stack), this application for photographers to post their own photos, critique others' photos, and form groups. 

What makes this application unique is its advanced critique feature. In addition to leaving general feedback, users can click anywhere on the photograph and leave notes about that specific area.
